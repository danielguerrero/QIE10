# QIE10
QIE10 plotter for different variables

The runPlotter.py file is designed to show the different variables of the QIE10 chip test. It also contains a plotter for TH2D comparison between two varibles.

The file runPlottersplit.py file is designed the variables of the QIE10 chip test. It compares two groups of chip when you apply a cut on Volt_ref. It also compares the groups of chip using a hatched band and poisson errors.

An example of how it looks can be found in this twiki page:
